# ✅ Zed Pluto Extension - Setup Complete

Your Zed extension for the Pluto language has been successfully configured and built using the Cypher extension as a reference!

## 🎯 What's Been Accomplished

### ✅ Extension Structure (Following Cypher Pattern)
- **extension.toml**: Properly configured with grammar references
- **src/lib.rs**: Rust extension implementation with proper Zed API usage
- **Cargo.toml**: Correct dependencies and build configuration
- **extension.wasm**: Built and ready for Zed

### ✅ Language Support
- **languages/pluto/config.toml**: Language configuration with file extensions (.pluto, .pl)
- **Tree-sitter Grammar**: Complete grammar in `languages/pluto/tree-sitter-pluto/`
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Comprehensive highlighting rules in `highlights.scm`
- **Code Folding**: Proper folding rules in `fold.scm`
- **Language Injections**: Basic injection support in `injections.scm`

### ✅ Build System
- **build.sh**: Automated build script
- **Verified Builds**: Both Rust extension and Tree-sitter grammar build successfully
- **Test File**: `test.pluto` with comprehensive language examples

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

### Option 1: Dev Extension (Recommended for Development)
1. Open Zed
2. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + X` to open Extensions
3. Click "Install Dev Extension"
4. Navigate to and select the `/home/shaurya/Desktop/zed-pluto` directory
5. The extension will be installed and activated

### Option 2: Manual Build and Install
```bash
cd /home/shaurya/Desktop/zed-pluto
./build.sh
# Then follow Option 1 steps
```

## 🧪 Testing

1. Create a new file with `.pluto` extension
2. Copy content from `test.pluto` or write your own Pluto code
3. Verify syntax highlighting works for:
   - Comments (`# comment`)
   - Variables (`name = "value"`)
   - Commands (`print "hello"`)
   - Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `==`, etc.)
   - Keywords (`if`, `else`, `function`, etc.)
   - Literals (strings, numbers, booleans)

## 🔧 Based on Cypher Extension Pattern

This extension follows the same structure and patterns as the reference Cypher extension:
- ✅ Simplified `extension.toml` with grammar repository reference
- ✅ Proper Tree-sitter integration
- ✅ Comprehensive syntax highlighting
- ✅ Language configuration following Zed conventions
- ✅ Build system and documentation

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

Your Pluto language extension is now ready for use in Zed. The extension provides:
- Full syntax highlighting for Pluto language constructs
- Automatic file type detection for `.pluto` and `.pl` files
- Code folding for blocks and structures
- Comment support (line and block comments)
- Proper bracket matching and auto-closing

Install it in Zed and start coding in Pluto with full editor support!
